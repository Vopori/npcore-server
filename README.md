### Welcome 👋🏼,

# 🛠️ Current Phase: Testing (Expect some issues).
# 🗣️ Discord Server: https://discord.gg/ahbEjHTfRm
# 🧩 Tracker: https://github.com/users/npcore-framework/projects/1

We are an open source community built of the NoPixel inspired framework (NPCore) users that are continually enhancing the project we are working on.
The primary goal with this project is to ensure utilization of the server files are as simple as possible, for new or experienced developers alike.

While we grow together and gain momentum in our development, expect detailed wiki information on how to use, modify or code within the framework!
Our hope is that we can do this wonderful framework justice by bringing the project's core to elevated heights!

Please note, the entirety of the this Wiki, Git-Hub & Discord is based on a community-driven project and we do not own any rights to the framework nor will even claim to.
We appreciate any and all pull requests or issues made to further the development phase!

All rights are reserved to the original creator of this great framework, we thank you for opening doors and paving ways!
